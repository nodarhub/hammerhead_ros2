# Introduction

This repo contains several examples demonstrating how to interact with Hammerhead using ROS2.

## Quick Start

You can use this repo like a ROS2 workspace. Specifically, if all the dependencies are installed, then you simply need
to clone this repo and call `colcon build` to build all the examples:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:nodarsensor/hammerhead_ros2.git
cd hammerhead_ros2
colcon build
```

The two convenience scripts `compile.sh` and `clean.sh` build and clean all the examples while making sure that all the
build artifacts always remain in the same place.

To run the examples, please refer to the individual README's.
