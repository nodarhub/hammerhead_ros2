# Introduction

This example demonstrates how to subscribe to `ObstacleData` messages, and save that data in `.txt` files in an
`obstacle_data` folder. The header of each generated file contains information about the order of parameters.

The obstacle data is represented in the XZ plane, where each obstacle is defined by a bounding box and a velocity
vector. Because this data is only in the XZ plane, there is no concept of *top* and *bottom* planes.
Similarly, the velocity vector does not have any vertical component (along what we would call the Y-axis).

NOTE: The velocity vectors are a work in progress. Right now they are being pushlished as zeros. In a future update to
Hammerhead, we will deliver nonzero values.

## Quick Start

Place this example along with the `hammerhead_msgs` folder in a ROS2 workspace. 
That is, your directory structure should look like:

    hammerhead_ros2_ws/
        src/
            hammerhead_msgs/
            obstacle_data_generator_py/

From the root of the workspace, build the message types and this example:

    cd hammerhead_ros2_ws
    colcon build

Finally, register the packages with ROS2, and run the obstacle detector generator

    . install/setup.bash
    ros2 run obstacle_data_generator_py obstacle_data_generator_py 

Internally, the `obstacle_data_generator_py` subscribes to the `nodar/obstacle_data` topic generated by hammerhead, and
writes that data to `.txt` files.
